Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

CODE:

a=input()
b=sorted(a)
for i in b:
    print(i,end='')

CODE:

a=input()
b=''
c=''
d=''
for i in a:
    if(i=='0'):
        b=b+i
    elif(i=='1'):
        c=c+i
    elif(i=='2'):
        d=d+i
print(b+c+d)
